      <p className="text-general mt-6">Hi, I&apos;m Sean.</p>
      <p className="text-general mt-6">
        I&apos;ve had a very non-traditional path into Software Engineering,
        having taught myself JavaScript online whilst taking my A levels,
        landing my first full time role and opting to take that instead of
        attending university.
      </p>
      <hr className="w-4  my-6" />
      <p className="text-general">
        I&apos;ve always maintained an extremely pragmatic approach to solving
        business problems with well designed code.
      </p>
      <p className="text-general mt-6">
        Since my first two years of professional experience, I have taken a
        hiatus from my professional career and taken the time to learn the
        theory behind my work deeply. This involved self-teaching Computer
        Science topics, including but not limited to: Data Structures &
        Algorithms, Systems Design and Front End technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-general mt-6">
        Outside of tech, I have an eclectic mix of interests, from traveling the
        world as a Digital Nomad, to competing in Mixed Martial Arts to Chess.
      </p>
      <p className="text-general mt-6">
        I&apos;m deeply passionate about tackling big problems in all fields and
        love to jump in head first to new challenges.
